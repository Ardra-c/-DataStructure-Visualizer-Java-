This Java-based project features an interactive GUI that enables users to visualize and manipulate fundamental data structures such as arrays, stacks, queues, and linked lists. Through real-time operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal, users can observe dynamic changes and gain a practical understanding of these concepts. Designed for both learners and developers, the tool offers an intuitive interface to simplify the exploration of core data structure fundamentals.
